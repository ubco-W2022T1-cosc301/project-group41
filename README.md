## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Happiness is defined as the state of being happy. We are interested in this because happiness isn’t easily quantifiable, so it is an exciting topic. Our main goal in this analytics project is to observe the trends in happiness over the selected timeframe and see how certain changes in the economy and overall trust in the government affected the happiness scale. This topic stood out to our group due to its flexibility and its relevance in today's political climate. Companies and governments base their policies and decisions on happiness data, and overall satisfaction from citizens plays a major role in politics. The specific research question that we want to explore is the relationship between people’s trust in the government and said government’s economy and how that relates to overall happiness. Building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset will be successful due to the extensive information available with many interpretations. This allows for many topics to be discussed and researched.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The World Happiness Report dataset gathers data from the Gallup World Poll and ranks 155 countries on a happiness scale. This is determined based on many factors such as GDP per capita, family, life expectancy, freedom, governmental trust, generosity, and dystopia residual. This dataset spans 2015 to 2016 and asks participants to rate their overall happiness on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being the worst and 10 being the best possible life. The samples were then weighted to account for unequal selection, ensuring that the data was accurate and unbiased. All the data in the World Happiness Report is then compared to Dystopia, an imaginary country whose data is equal to the worst national averages for each factor. This report is relevant to current events as general happiness is beginning to be an indicator for policy-making decisions across the globe. A country's happiness report is vital regarding social and economic resolutions.
